# PyMosh-Project2

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that guesess the favorite music genre of a person based on their age and gender. I used the pandas data analysis package from the Jupyter framework to run my computer as it's own python server.

Head to https://www.anaconda.com/download to download anaconda to install Jupyter.
